Hi, my name is Vighnesh Avadhanam, Within economics, I am largely interested in applied microeconomics and industrial organization. My interests in programming are largely to gain data science skills in R and Python. For projects, I am particularly interested in looking at market research, fiscal policy, or macroeconomic data.
